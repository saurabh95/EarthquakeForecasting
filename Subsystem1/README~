SUBSYSTEM1: Making of Seismic Table for prevoius earthquakes and providing input to other subsystems

In main.php we are having faults as input and output is the Seismic HTML Table of the prevoius 200 years earthquakes that are there in the database.
There is a fault array which can be changed accordingly if we want some other set of faults (for some other specific city)
